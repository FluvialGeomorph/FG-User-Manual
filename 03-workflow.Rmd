# Workflow
This chapter provides an overview of the workflow that will be used to perform a rapid watershed assessment using `FluvialGeomorph`. 

* Provide roadmap or overview of the stages users need to take. 
* Help orient users with overview to give them the big picture before throwing them into the details. 
* Describe the forest (workflow) before describing the trees (geoprocessing).  
* Why each Stage is important
* Describe Stages, Steps, Tasks and Tools

## Workflow Overview
Provide a narrative overview of the workflow.

### Create Terrain
* What will be accomplished for each stage?
* Describe how previous stage (outputs) flows into the current stage (inputs).
