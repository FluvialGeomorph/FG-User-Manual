See the [Guide for Preparing Technical Information Reports of the Engineer Research and Development Center](http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a445281.pdf) for details on ERDC Technical Report development. 


## Abstract
The abstract appears on the reverse side of the title page. It summarizes
the research problem, project objective, and outcome of the investigation.
It should run no more than 200 words. 


## Disclaimer
Also on the reverse side of the title
page is the standard disclaimer of any implied government endorsement
of products discussed in text. 


## Distribution Statement
The distribution statement is a critical component of both the cover and
the title page. Every ERDC technical publication must be imprinted with
one of the seven primary distribution statements required by Department
of Defense Directive (DoDD) 5230.24. A distribution statement constitutes
ERDC’s decision on who is authorized to read the report. Most reports
published by ERDC are intended for unrestricted public access and carry
Statement A: “Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited.”
However, access to many reports may need to be restricted for reasons
ranging from proprietary information content to national security interests
related to militarily critical technology. Appendix B presents the text
of every nonclassified distribution statement and the approved justifica-
ERDC/ITL SR-04-1 8
tions for applying each one. Only reports labeled with Statement A shall be
posted to the World Wide Web for unrestricted public access. 


## Preface
A preface is included in all ERDC reports to present essential nontechnical
documentation of the research project, such as funding authorization,
sponsorship, technical contributors to project execution, chain of
supervision, and the authors’ acknowledgments. Figure A3 presents a
sample showing all the required elements. 


## Unit Conversion Factors
A unit conversion factors table is included in all reports that do not use
metric units or dual units. The table should include only those U.S. customary
units used in the report. It should be compiled from the master list
of conversion factors maintained by PTTB. For more information, see
“Expressing and converting units of measure” (page 14). 


## Notation List
A notation list also may be included to define characters, symbols, and abbreviations used to express technical facts or quantities. It appears after
the unit conversion factors. Figure A4 presents a formatted sample. @R-base

# Introduction

## Background
The background section defines the problem addressed by the research
and its impact on the U.S. Army. It cites related previous studies and explains
why the current research is necessary. It also may present other
background information that provides essential context for the reader. Examples
include the following:

* controlling regulations or legal requirements
* prospective users of the report or the technology. 


## Objective
The objective is a concise statement of what the research is intended to accomplish.


## Approach
The approach section explains the research methodology. If the methodology
is complex or otherwise warrants a chapter of its own, the approach
section may simply cross-reference the reader to the appropriate chapter.


## Other Sections
[ANSI/NISO Z39.18-2005](https://groups.niso.org/apps/group_public/download.php/12038/Z39_18_2005_R2010.pdf) does not prohibit additional sections in the introductory chapter. For example, a scope section may be helpful to explain
any limitations, caveats, etc., of which the reader should be aware. In some
cases, supplementary technology transfer1 or contact information also
may be appropriate for the intended audience. 

1 This information might include online sources for required computer software or related technical information. Recommendations on mode of technology transfer, however, will usually be presented in the concluding chapter rather than the introductory chapter.

## Create Terrain

### Develop Elevation Model
The purpose of this step is to develop a DEM for the study area. 

* Obtain an off-the-shelf DEM for the study area. 
* Determine if sufficient resolution exists in the channel. 
* If not, assemble LAS data for the channel. 
* Create LAS dataset of study area. 
* Set the LAS Dataset projection to the coordinate system UTM (select appropriate Zone based on location of the study area), Datum: NAD83. 
* Select LAS classes that contain non-vegetation points within the channel. 
* Use the `LAS Dataset to Raster` tool to export to raster. 
    * Z-Factor: 3.28084
    * Cell assignment Type: IDW
    * Void Fill Method: Natural Neighbor
    * Cell size: 1 foot (0.3048 meters)
* Create a `study_area` polygon feature class that delineates the extent of the study area. Use this feature class to clip the DEM to the desired study area. Edit this polygon to remove any elevation anomolies around the edges of the DEM. These anomolies are sometimes created by the `LAS Dataset to Raster` tool. 

### Elevation Model Hydro Modification
The purpose of this step is to create a hydro-modified DEM to ensure proper water flow across the study area. 

* Examine the stream channel through the study area and determine if there are any blockages to flow in the DEM. These blockages are typically built infrastructure such as road embankments where streams are conveyed through culverts or underground stormwater structures. 
* If there are flow blockages in the study area, create a new line feature class named `cutlines` to store terrain modifications that remove flow blockages. This feature class must be in the same coordinate system as the DEM being modified. 
* In an edit session, identify human structures that block flow along the stream reach being studied. Draw a line beginning at the upstream side of the blockage to a point just downstream of the blockage. 
* Use the `02 - Burn Cutlines` tool to "burn" the `cutlines` features into the DEM. This tool creates the `dem_hydro` raster. 


### Define Stream Reaches
The purpose of this step is to create a synthetic flow network of streams for the study area. 

* Use the `03 - Contributing Area` tool to calculate the contributing area for the study area. If created, use the `dem_hydro` raster as input, otherwise use the original study area DEM. The `processes` parameter can be safely set to approximately 2 less than the number of cores on the computer running the tool. 
* Use the `04 - Stream Network` tool to create a synthetic stream network from the hydro-modified DEM. The `processes` parameter can be safely set to approximately 2 less than the number of cores on the computer running the tool. The `threshold` parameter should be set to a value of 200,000 to 500,000 depending on the study area. If the resulting `stream_network` is too dense (requiring a large amount of editing to remove extraneous tributaries), try rerunning the tool and increasing the `threshold` value. Conversely, if the resulting `stream_network` is too sparse (not enough of the stream network was delineated), try rerunning the tool and decreasing the `threshold` value. 
* Edit the resulting `stream_network` feature class to remove all tributary streams that do not constitute the network that will be analyzed in this study. 
* Edit the `stream_network` feature class to ensure that stream segments are represented by a single line and that there are no gaps in the steam network. 
* Use the `Field Calculator` tool to set the `Name` field to the name of the site being analyzed. 
* Use the `05 - Create Flowline` tool to process the `stream_network` feature class that was just edited to produce a new `flowline` feature class. Use a smoothing tolerance from 5-20. The goal is produce a smooth flowline, but not remove too much resolution from the line (ensure the line remains in the channel and not cut into the floodplain). 
* Edit the `flowline` feature class to ensure that the flowline is digitized beginning with the downstream and digitized upstream. In an edit session, select the flowline, choose to edit vertices, and ensure that the red endpoint is at the upstream end of the flowline. Use the flip command to ensure flowline is digitized in the correct direction. 


### Extract Stream Reach Profile Points
The purpose of this step is convert the flowline into a series of points along the stream. This tool takes the flowline feature class, converts it to a route, calculates the distance to the mouth of the river for all vertices, and creates a stream profile points feature class. The flowline feature class was created during the hydro modification process. 

* Use the `06 Stream Profile Points` tool to convert the `flowline` feature class into stream profile points. For this study, set the `km_to_mouth` parameter to 0 and the `station_distance` field to 1 meter.  


## Detrend DEM


### Detrend Elevation Model
The purpose of this step is to produce a detrended DEM. A detrended DEM normalizes stream bank elevations for a given reach. 

* Use the `07 - Detrend` tool to create a detrended DEM for the study reach. For this study, set the `buffer_distance` field to 100 meters. 


## Define Channel Extent

### Delineate the Initial Channel Extent
The purpose of this step is to use the detrended DEM to extract an initial channel extent polygon. 

* The `detrend` DEM created in the last step can be used to explore innundation extents at various water surface elevations. Add the `detrend` feature class to ArcMap. On the Symbology tab, use the Classified renderer to classify the raster into 2 classes. Set the first class boundary to the detrended elevation that you would like to explore. Set the color of the first class (min value - detrended elevation) to blue and the color of the second class (detrended elevation - max value) to No Color. 
* To delineate the channel extent, select a detrended elevation that innundates the channel up to at least the first terrace. The goal at this stage is to select a detrended elevation that captures the channel without going too far into the floodplain. Try several detrended elevation values to help make the decision. 
* When you have chosen a detrended elevation, use the `08 - Bankfull Polygon` tool to extract a channel area polygon. This tool creas a new polygon feature class named `banks_raw_xxx`, where xxx is the detrended elevation selected. 
* This feature class must be edited to select the channel area polygon(s). Open the attribute table for the `banks_raw_xxx` feature class and use advanced sorting to sort first by `gridcode` and then by `Shape_Area`. Polygons with `gridcode` = 1 are polygons innundated at the detrended elevation. Typically, the polygons with the largest area represent the channel. Begin selecting `gridcode` = 1 polygons with the largest area until the entire channel area is selected. 
* Export these selected features to a new feature class named `banks_xxx`, where xxx is the detrended elevation selected. 


### Create Channel Slope Raster
The purpose of this step is to create a channel slope raster that can be used in the visual identification of riffe locations in following step. 

* Use the `09 - Channel Slope` tool to calculate a raster of the channel slope. This tool creates a new feature class named `channel_slope`. 


## Map Riffles

### Map Riffle Cross Sections
The purpose of this step is to identify and map riffe locations. Riffles will be used in later steps to determine the bankfull elevation from gage stage discharge relationships. Riffle locations are identified using the `channel_slope` raster calculated in the last step (and confirmed with high resolution aerial imagery). In the `channel_slope` raster, pools appear as relatively smooth areas of low slope due to the absence of LiDAR points (deep water absorbs laser pulses). Shallow water riffles appear as highly textured areas of relatively higher slope between pools due to the higher number of LiDAR points from the exposed bed material.

* Create a new line feature class named `riffle` to store riffle cross sections. This feature class must be in the same coordinate system as the DEM. 

* Riffle locations should have the following characteristics: 
    * A straight reach between two meander bends, areas in the cross-overs between river bends
    * Clear indicators of of the active floodplain or bankfull discharge
    * Presence of one or more terraces
    * Channel section and form typical of the stream
    * A reasonably clear view of of geomorphic features
    * Areas of high water surface slope 
    * Areas of minimum depth and width
    * Channel width parallel and consistent 
    * Avoid tributary influences

* Digitize cross sections beginning with the left descending bank. In an edit session, use the flip command to ensure cross sections are digitized in the correct direction. A red vertex denotes the end of a line segment. 
* Ensure that cross sections are digitized to a detrended elevation of at least 108 to 112 feet. Use the raster classification technique described above (Bankfull Polygon section) to explore innundation extents to identify this maximum detrended elevation that riffle cross sections should delineated to. 
* Since riffle cross sections should be delineated in locations where there are clear indicators of of the active floodplain or bankfull discharge, ensure that riffle cross sections include at least a portion of the adjacent floodplain. Including at least a portion of the adjacent floodplain allows a fluvial geomorphologist the ability to examine the elevation of the floodplain. Including a 20- to 50-feet section should be sufficient. 


## Calculate Riffle Geometry

### Assign Cross Section IDs
The purpose of this step is to ensure that cross section identifiers are properly assigned to allow later tools to run correctly. 

* Add a long integer field named `Seq` to the `riffle` feature class to hold the unique number of the cross section. This will be used to iterate through cross sections. 
* Assign integer values to the `Seq` field starting with one. Begin numbering at the downstream extent of the study area and moving upstream. 

### Calculate Cross Section Watershed Area
The purpose of this step is calculate the watershed area of each cross section. The watershed area draining to each cross section will be used in later steps to define several hydraulic geometry relationships. 

* Add the NHDPlus flow accumulation `NHDPlus_FAC` that has been clipped to the study region to an ArcMap document. Measure the distance from the flowline to each cross section to determine the snap distance required. 
* Use the `12 - XS Watershed Area` tool to calculate the watershed area for each cross section. 


### Assign Cross Section River Position
The purpose of this step is to assign a river position to each cross section. The river position of each cross section will be used in later steps to calculate several channel parameters (i.e., gradient, sinuosity). 

* Use the `13 - XS Assign River Position` tool to calculate the distance to the mouth of the river for each cross section. 


### Calculate Cross Section Station Points
The purpose of this step is convert the cross section line feature class into a point feature class representing cross section station points. This feature class will be used in later steps to calculate hydraulic geometry dimensions. 

* Use the `14 - XS Create Station Points` tool to calculate cross section station points for each cross section. For this study, set the `station_distance` parameter to 0.3048 meter (1 foot). This tool creates a new feature class named `cross_section_points`. 
* Export the `cross_section_points` feature class attribute table to a text file named `<study_area>_cross_section_points.csv`, where `<study_area>` is the name of the study area. 


### Check Cross Sections
The purpose of this step is to plot each cross section to check that it was digitized correctly. 

* Use the `15 - XS Plot` tool to plot each riffle cross section. Make an educated guess at the value of `bankfull_elevation` for the purpose of this QA check. 
* After creating a plot of the first cross section, in the `R Graphics` window, turn on recording (`History|Recording`) to keep a record of the subsequent cross section plots created during this session. Use the keyboard's `Page Up` and `Page Down` keys to scroll through the plots. If you make a mistake, use the `History|Clear History` menu item to clear the previously recorded graphs. 
* Use the plots to check that the digitized cross sections have the following characteristics:
    * Banks should be digitized to a high enough elevation sufficient to contain the anticipated bankfull elevation. This is typically between a detrended elevation of 108 to 112 feet. However, do not exceed this elevation as it will reduce the resolution of the geomorphic features within the the channel displayed on the graph. 
    * Left and right banks are digitized to a similar elevation. One bank should not be extremely higher that the other. 
    * A geomorphologist will provide you with feedback on the bankfull elevation and maximum elevation to use for each stream reach. As a result, the cross section digitizing process will necessarily be iterative based on feedback from a fluvial geomorphologist. 
    * Ensure that cross sections are digitized into a portion of the adjacent floodplain. Cross sections should extend 20 to 50 feet into the floodplain.

# Summary
The concluding chapter is the last chapter in the main body of the report
before the reference list. The title and content may vary depending on the
project type and audience. The chapter is usually called “Summary,” “Conclusions,” or “Conclusions and Recommendations.”

A technical report may conclude with a summary chapter if its purpose is
to document empirical observations or straightforward research findings
such as the results of a field demonstration or a laboratory test series. A
summary typically reviews the research results in more detail than the abstract.

A chapter of conclusions differs from a summary chapter in that it presents
or reviews the author’s technical interpretation of the research results.
Conclusions concisely help the reader to understand how the research
objective was met and what the results mean in terms of the Army problem described in the background section. Conclusions should be included
for every secondary objective stated in the introductory chapter.

Most reports will include recommendations for the project sponsor. Recommendations generally will pertain to (1) how the research product or
results should be used to address the problem defined in the first chapter
or (2) what the sponsor may do to transition a technology product into advanced
development, field demonstration, or commercialization.

# References {-}
'`
A reference list is presented immediately after the final numbered chapter
of the report, but before any appendixes. Formats and styles prescribed in
the Chicago Manual of Style should be used. Most ERDC reports will use
the author-date system and corresponding reference list form described in
the Chicago Manual. An alternative style prescribed in the Chicago Manual,
the note-bibliography system, may be used by authors working in disciplines
in which that style is customary. 

The reference list should include every information source cited in text
plus any uncited sources that were drawn upon. The reference list for this
Guide, presented on page 28, may be used as a model for common types of
source documentation including books, serial publications, government
documents, and unpublished material.
