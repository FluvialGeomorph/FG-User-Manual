# Install

This chapter will describe the process for installing and configuring the `FluvialGeomorph` software components. 

## Software Requirements
The following summary of the software that must be installed to use the FluvialGeomorph toolbox. The rest of this chapter will describe how to complete these installations. 

* R Statistical Computing Language (3.6.3+ recommended)
* RStudio Desktop (1.3+ recommended), optional
* TauDEM (5.3.7+ recommended)
* ArcGIS Pro (2.6+ recommended) or ArcGIS Desktop (10.8+ recommended)
* FluvialGeomorph toolbox latest version


### Install `R`
`R` is a statistical computing environment required to perform calculations and report generation. 
* Ensure that `R` is installed. 
* `R` version 3.6.3 or greater is recommended. 


### Install `RStudio`
`Rstudio` is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for `R` that streamlines development and troubleshooting. 
* Ensure that `Rstudio` is installed.
* `RStudio` version 1.3 or greater is recommended. 

## Install TauDEM
Install the latest version of [TauDEM](https://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem/taudem5/), v5.3.7.

### Install `ArcGIS Pro`
`ArcGIS Pro` is the GIS environment where the FMG data will be developed and the toolbox will be run from. 
* Ensure that `ArcGIS Pro` is installed. 
* `ArcGIS Pro` version 2.6 or greater is recommended. 

### Download the `arcgisbinding` package
The `arcgisbinding` `R` package allows `ArcGIS Pro` and `ArcMap` to read and write to R. Installing it through `ArcGIS Pro` also enables it for use in `ArcMap` as well. *Note: The ArcGIS R-bridge does not yet support R 4.0 for use in ArcGIS Pro or ArcMap geoprocessing tools.* See the [NEWS](NEWS.md) for more details on version compatibility. Please manually download the specified version using these instructions. 

* Navigate to the following URL: [https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/r-bridge](https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/r-bridge)
* In the "Releases" section on the middle-right side of the page, click the "+ xx releases" link. 
* Download the `v1.0.1.239` version. This file is named:  `arcgisbinding_1.0.1.239.zip`
* Note the location of the file you just downloaded. We will use it in a following step.

### Install the `arcgisbinding` package
The `arcgisbinding` `R` package is developed and maintained by ESRI to support the import and export of GIS data into `R`. 

* In `ArcGIS Pro`, on the top menu, click "Project", and click "Options" on the left menu.
* In the "Options" dialog box, click "Geoprocessing" on the left menu. 
* On the "Geoprocessing" page, scroll down to the "R-ArcGIS Support" section.
* In the "R-ArcGIS Support" section, verify the installed `R` version for ArcGIS to use.
* Select an `R` version in the 3.6.x series.  
* Below the "Detected R home directories" drop-down menu, you will see the `arcgisbinding` package section. From the drop-down, choose the "Update from file" option. Navigate to the `arcgisbinding_1.0.1.239.zip` file you downloaded in an earlier step and click the OK button. 


## Install FluvialGeomorph
The code in the [FluvialGeomorph-toolbox/](https://github.com/FluvialGeomorph/FluvialGeomorph-toolbox/) repository contains all of the files needed to use this ArcGIS toolbox. 

* In the "Releases" section above on the right side of the page, click the green "latest" link. 
* On the latest release page, use the "Source code (zip)" link to download a ZIP archive of the toolbox. 
* Unzip the archive to your project folder. 
* In `ArcMap` or `ArcGIS Pro`, navigate to the folder where you just unzipped the archive and you are ready to use this ArcGIS toolbox.
