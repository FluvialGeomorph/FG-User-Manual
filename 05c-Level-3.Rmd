# Level 3 Workflow
This chapter describes the workflow steps necessary to complete a Level 3 FluvialGeomorph analysis. The purpose of this level is to extract planform dimensions. This section will provide a brief overview of the Level 3 (L3) workflow.

## Define Valley Line
The purpose of this stage is to define the valley trend line for the base year for each reach. 

### Determine Final Floodplain Extent
The purpose of this step is to use the detrended bankfull elevation identified in L2 to delineate the active floodplain. 

### Develop Candidate Valleylines
The purpose of this step is to create a set of candidate valleylines through iterative smoothing of the flowline for each reach. 

### Choose Final Valleyline
The purpose of this step is to choose from the candidate valleylines the one that best captures the overall valley trend line.

## Define Meander Loops
The purpose of this stage is to define meander loops and bends for the base year for each reach. 

### Define Loop Points
The purpose of this step is to create a new FC named `loop_points` and use it to identify the start and end stream meander loops and bends. 

### Derive Bankline Points
The purpose of this step is to convert the banklines to a set of points and assign elevations and loop and bend locations. 

### Assign Cross Section Loops
The purpose of this step is to assign loop and bend identifiers to regularly spaced and riffle cross section FCs for each reach.

## Calculate L3 Cross Section Geometry
The purpose of this stage is to calculate the Level 3 dimensions for each reach. 

### Calculate Cross Section L3 Dimensions
The purpose of this step is to calculate the L3 dimensions for the regularly spaced and riffle cross section FCs for each reach.

## Run Report
The purpose of this stage is to run the Level 3 report for each reach. 

### Run the L3 Report
The purpose of this step is to run the L2 report for each reach. 

### Perform QA
The purpose of this step is to use the QA Checklist to verify the reports have run correctly and identify any data mistakes that need to be corrected.
