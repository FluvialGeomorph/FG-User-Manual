Customers define specific goals for each project that determine the specific workflow chosen. These goals define a project study area for each project. These project study areas typically consist of a particular watershed, a mainstem section of a named river, or a discrete stream reach.\nSite: Project areas are subdivided into “sites”. Sites are typically named tributaries and their subwatersheds within the project study area.\nReach: Sites are further subdivided into “reaches”. Reaches are defined according to project goals and use conventional rules for specifying reaches (i.e., tributary confluence to confluence), significant infrastructure, changes in surficial geology, etc.\nYear: Since FluvialGeomorph analysis is based on LiDAR terrain surveys, the timing of the survey is a critical factor in the analysis. LiDAR is a single point-in-time dataset. Since LiDAR can be collected periodically, our data structure must accommodate multiple distinct time periods (typically separated by years) for which channel dimensions are extracted. If there are multiple LiDAR surveys available for the project study area, the most recent survey is referred to as the base year.",

The workflow begins with developing FCs that define the project study area, Digital Elevation Models (DEM), derived stream network, etc. If there are multiple LiDAR surveys for the project study area, a separate study area geodatabase representing each survey is created beginning with the base year.\nSite Geodatabase:  This type of geodatabase stores FCs that apply to a specific site.

A standard folder structure has the following benefits:\n\nClearly defined functional roles for each storage location reduces ambiguity and confusion.\nPredictability reduces errors.\nStandard structure allows analysts to move between projects more easily.\n\nThe following folder structure is recommended to organize all project data:\nStudy_Area_Name\n└─── Sites\n│    └─── 01_Site_Name\n│    │    └─── Data\n│    │    │        Site1_year1.gdb\n│    │    │        Site1_year2.gdb\n│    │    │        Reach1_year1.gdb\n│    │    │        Reach1_year2.gdb\n│    │    │        Reach2_year1.gdb\n│    │    │        Reach2_year2.gdb\n│    │    │        ...\n│    │    └─── Elevation\n│    │    │        year1.gdb\n│    │    │        year2.gdb\n│    │    │        ...\n│    │    └─── Exports\n│    │    └─── Maps\n│    │    └─── Reports\n│    └─── 02_Site_Name\n│         ...\n└─── Elevation\n│    └─── ProjectName_Year1\n│    │    └─── LAS\n│    │    ProjectName_Year1.gdb\n│    └─── ProjectName_Year2\n│         └─── LAS\n│         ProjectName_Year2.gdb\n│         ...\n└─── Exports\n└─── Maps\n\n\nStudy Area Folder: The project study area folder is used to store all of the files for the project.\nSite Folders: Site folders are used to store all of the files for each site.

Site folder order can be controlled by prefixing a number to each site name.\nElevation Folders: The elevation folders are used to store all of the data required to create a DEM for each LiDAR survey event. A LAS subfolder at the project level is used to hold all of the point cloud data (typically delivered in .las format for modern surveys) for each LiDAR survey for the project study area. Since these datasets can be massive, the idea is to separate these data into their own folder to streamline data management. Once the terrain data are processed at the project study area level, only derived DEMs are then copied to the site and reach geodatabases in the site data folders.\nSite Data Folders: The site data folders are used to store all of the site site and reach geodatabases.\nReports: The Reports folders are used to store the reports created by tools for each reach.\nMaps: The Maps folders are used to store map documents for a given project or site.\nExports Folders: The Exports folders are used to store static .pdf map documents exported from map projects for a given project or site.",

All workflow steps are sequential and build on the outputs of previous steps.\n\nLevels: The top hierarchical grouping of the workflow. Levels are distinguished by the degree of fluvial geometric detail and metrics that will be derived. Levels 2 and 3 are optional.\nPhases: The second hierarchical grouping of the workflow. Each level is subdivided into stages. Stages are mostly a conceptual grouping of steps to accomplish a specific objective in the analysis chain.\nSteps: The third hierarchical grouping of the workflow. Stages are subdivided into steps.

This spreadsheet can be stored in the site folder while data development progresses. Records in this spreadsheet can be periodically appended to a project or team level version to improve team communication on project progress.\nCheck Tools: The FluvialGeomorph toolbox contains the Check toolset that allows the analyst to perform checks on the standard FluvialGeomorph FCs for basic rule compliance. If analysts have questions about if a specific FC is causing problems, these check tools can be used.\nTool Error Messages: A series of low-level defensive programming checks have been implemented across all FluvialGeomorph functions and tools to help head-off problems.\nQA Checklist: The QA Checklist helps analysts review the reports created using the tools to identify and fix problems in the underlying derived data.

    "text": "Analysis Workflow\n\nCreate a Boundary\n\n\n\n\n\nBoundary within 1 mile buffer\n\n\n\n\nRight click on feature dataset and click new Feature Class.\nName is boundary and keep feature class type as polygon.\nClick Finish.\nChange symbology to black outline.\nZoom to your site and create a polygon that surrounds the water system by roughly 100 feet. The distance should be taken from along the entire edge of the stream to account for available elevation data for later analysis.\n\n\n\nCreate a LAS Dataset\n\nIn the geoprocessing tab search Create LAS Dataset.\nIn the Input Files select the Folder where the LAS tiles were downloaded to.\nIn the Output LAS Dataset browse to the LPC folder where the two sets of LAS tiles are saved. Name it after the year.\nUnder Surface Constraints the input feature is Boundary.\nRight click on of the LAS files for the site and go to properties then coordinate system. Copy and paste the coordinate system into the geoprocessing tool.\nClick run.\n\n\n\n\n\nSee step 9\n\n\n\n\nOnce tool is finished running, Right click the dataset in the contents pane and select Properties. Under properties click LAS Filter.\nUnder Classification Codes, make sure only ground, water, and rail are checked. Uncheck all other boxes. Hit Ok.\nZoom to the site area to the extent of 1:2000. Make sure you see the classified dots labeled water and ground.\n\n\n\n\nTurn LAS Dataset to Raster\n\nIn the geoprocessing tab search LAS Dataset to Raster.\nThe Input LAS Dataset will be the one you created in the prior step. Make sure to use the dropdown arrow to select your LAS dataset. Do not drag it from the catalog pane. This will select the LAS dataset with the symbology changes you made prior.\nThe Output Raster location will be the geodatabase you created under the SSRP_Sites folder. Name it DEM_Year. Ex. DEM_2022\nValue field is Elevation.\nFor Interpolation Type select Binning.\nCell Assignment is IDW.\nVoid Fill Method is Natural Neighbor.\nOutput Data Type is Floating Point.\nFor coordinate system in state plane feet: Sampling Type is Cell Size. Change Sampling Value to 1 and Z Factor to 1.\nClick Run.\n\n\n\nChange Symbology of Raster\n\nClick on your created raster symbology.\nPrimary symbology should be stretch.\nChange the color scheme to Elevation #1.\nStretch type to Standard Deviation.\nStatistics to DRA.\n\n\n\nCheck Raster Pixel Size and columns and rows\n\nZoom into layer at the extent of 1:15.\nUse the measure tool to measure the length of pixel. Should be 1 ft.\n\nMake sure the measuring tool is set to feet or imperial.\n\nOpen properties and check that the columns have not been inflated to into the millions.\n\nIf there are number of columns in the millions re-run the Las to Raster and set the processing extent to boundary as well and then run again.\n\n\n\n\nCreate Cutlines Line Feature Class\n\nRight click your geodatabase and click new feature dataset.\nKeep Output Geodatabase\nFor the Feature Dataset Name, name is Site#_YEAR. Ex. Site263_2008.\nUse the dropdown box under coordinate system and select the corresponding LAS dataset to select the correct coordinate system.\nClick Run.\nRight click the newly created feature dataset and create new feature class.\nName it cutlines, Change feature class type to line, and finish.\nIdentify Flow Blockages\n\nGo to the edit ribbon and select create feature and select cutlines\nZoom to the start of the water system and change the extent to around 1:1000.\nFollow along the water system and look for roads or major crossings that cut off the water system. Draw a line from one end of the waterway to the other side that is cut off. Below are a few examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCutline example 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCutline example 2\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there are no blockages create a cutline at each end of the stream.\nWhen done, make sure to save edits before doing the next step.\n\n\n\nHydro Modify DEM\n\nIn the catalog pane, go to the FluvialGeomorph toolbox. Expand tools and select Hydro DEM.\nFor output_workspace, drag your geodatabase from the catalog pane (Created prior) into the space.\nFor cutlines, drag your cutline feature class into the space.\nFor dem, drag your raster dataset into the space.\nFor widen_cells put 4.\nClick Run.\n\nThe result is a DEM without the flow blockages and representing proper water flow across the study area.\n\n\n\n\nDerive Stream as Line Tool – Esri Spatial Analyst Toolbox\n\nOpen Derive Stream as Line tool\nSelect the dem_hydro as the input surface raster\n\n\nSet the output polyline as stream in the feature dataset.\n\n\nHit Run. Then repeat for the earlier geodatabase.\nChange color of streamlines to a bright color to see it better against the dem.\nDelete all tributaries or lines that are not the main low point flowline. Use split and edit vertices tools. Connect all lines together using the create feature tool.\n\nMake sure the streamline is going through the lowest part of the channel\n\nSave edits.\n\n\n\nSmooth Line Tool – Esri Cartography Toolbox\n\nSet smoothing between 2 and 15 depending on the size and flow of the channel.\nCheck that flowline remains in the channel. Edit flowline or rerun smooth as needed to keep line in channel.\n\n\n\nCreate Flowline\n\nIn the FluvialGeomorph toolbox, select the Flowline tool.\nFor the feature_dataset and stream_network drag and drop the corresponding data from the catalog.\nFor smooth_tolerance put 2. It can range from 2-5 based on the range of distribution of the flowline. The goal is to produce a smooth flowline without removing too much resolution from the line.\nHit Run Note: Make sure to do most recent data first. Rerun tool for older set of data once done.\nThe output is a line feature class called flowline. This tool derives the site flowline and smooths the stream_network geometry and converts the flowline into a route.\nEnsure that the flowline remains in the channel and is not simplified into the floodplain. If this occurs, rerun reducing the degree of smoothing.\n\nAlso ensure that the red endpoint (vertice) is at the upstream end of the flowline. It is critical that the flowline is digitized in the upstream direction. If this step is not performed, all subsequent tools will malfunction.\n\nOpen attribute table for each flowline and stream network.\nThe Reach Name must be the same for each flowline and stream network. The name is the Site# and survey event. Ex. Site 264 KANE-DUPAGE County SWCD\nCheck that the flowline is in and near the center of the main channel represented in the ydro_dem.\n\n\n\nCreate Flowline Points\n\nIn the FluvialGeomorph toolbox, select the Flowline Points tool.\nFor this tool make sure you do the most recent data first. Find the corresponding data for flowline in the feature dataset.\nThe dem will be the dem_hydro.\nKm_to_mouth will be 0 in most circumstances.\nFor station_distance put 1. This means there will be a station point for every foot along the flowline.\nThe calibration points, point id field, and measure field will be blank for the most recent data.\n\n\nLeave the search radius default.\nHit run.\nNote: Before you run the flowline points for the older dataset, make sure the newer flowline points tool is done running.\nFor the older dataset, fill in the information like when running the tool for the newer data.\nFor calibration points, drag the flowline points created from the newer data.\nThe point id field is ReachName.\nMeasure field is POINT_M\nHit run.\nThe result converts the flowline into a series of points along the reach. The tool converts the flowline feature class into a route, calculates the distance to the mouth of the river for all vertices, and creates a flowline_points feature class.\n\n\n\nCreate Features\n\nCreate a new point feature class in either year feature dataset.\nAdd fields for Name (text) and km_to_mouth (double).\nDrag the ‘features’ feature class into the map. Move it to first in drawing order.\nTurn off all layers except the flowline points, so you can see the basemap.\nOn the ribbon, click edit and create features.\nYou will create feature at the site # and any other major features on the basemap that the flowline points cross, likes a road, waterway with name, or lake. First, use the explore tool to click on a flowline point. Create the feature on top of the flowline point you selected.\n\nServe as reference on the profile graph in the report.\n\nIn the table find the number next to “Measure”. Take note of this number, you will add it to the table once you create the feature.\nOpen attribute table for ‘features’. Under km_to_mouth put the number that was correlated with “Measure”.\nThe name in most cases will just be the name of the street or waterway. For the Site# feature, the name will be Site# and the SSRP_Type found in the attribute table of Illinois_SSRPSites_2004_2016. Ex. Site 264 STP;RR\n\n\n\nReuse the feature layer in future sites\n\nRight click on the feature dataset for most recent data. Go to import and select Feature Class(es).\nFor the input features, go to a previous county folder and expand the feature dataset for the most recent geodatabase under any Site# and import that database layer called features.\nFor the output geodatabase, choose the corresponding feature dataset. This allows the use of a layer with existing fields.\n\n\n\nREM\n\nIn the FluvialGeomorph toolbox, select the REM tool.\nFill in the parameters with the corresponding data. Make sure for dem you choose the hydro_dem.\nBuffer distance will be 1500.\nHit run. Note: You will not be able to create features and run this tool at the same time.\n\nThe purpose of this step is to produce a REM. This DEM normalizes stream bank elevations for a specific reach.\n\nSelect the symbology for the REM.\nChange the renderer from Stretch to the Classify.\nChange number of classes to two.\nIn the first class, change the upper value to 100 and note how the REM changes.\n\nAdd onto by this upper value until the dem fills the bank and right before it starts ‘overflowing’ into the floodplain, which is 2 times the depth of the channel.\nGet an elevation at the bank and then the center of the channel and add the difference to the 100 first class value.\n\n\n\n\nFind the Channel and Floodplain\n\nHave the flowline, demhydro and REM for the newer year.\nFind the elevation in the REM for the bank and the flowline. Check multiple locations along the stream, including the site location.\nFind the average difference in elevation between the bank and the flowline.\n\nSubtract the two REM values to get the bankfull depth for the channel. Ex. bank elevation 104 and flowline elevation 100 then the channel depth is 104. This value is used in the Water Surface Extent tool as the REM_value. This will become the channel bank_raw value.\nNext Multiply the last number of the channel bank_raw value by 2 and use it as the REM_value for the floodplain bank_raw. Ex. channel bank_raw 104 make the floodplain bank_raw 108.\n\n\n\nCreate Water Surface Extent\n\nIn the FluvialGeomorph toolbox, select the Water Surface Extent tool.\nFill in the feature dataset and the REM for from the most recent year.\nEnter the depth value found for the channel\nSet smoothing to 5.\nHit Run\nRun again for the floodplain depth.\n\n\n\nEdit the Channel and Floodplain Banks_raw layers\n\n\n\n\nSample of a channel bank and floodplain layer\n\n\n\n\nOpen the attribute table for the channel banks_raw. Sort the Shape_Area column descending.\nUse the gridcode column value of 1 to find the highest row(s) that make up the stream channel around the flowline. With the channel polygons selected switch the selection and delete all other polygons leaving only the stream channel.\nThe channel banks_raw need to be trimmed of any incoming confluences. Then save the edits.\nRepeat Create Water Surface Extent for the floodplain banks_raw layer. Leave an additional area or confluences.\n\n\n\nCreate Cross Sections (only for newest dataset)\n\nIn the FluvialGeomorph toolbox, select the XS Layout tool.\nFill in the feature dataset and flowline from the most recent geodatabase.\nFor split type keep as “split at approximate distance.”\nTransect spacing is 300.\nTransect_width is determined by width of floodplain from the flowline. Find the distance of the farthest point of the floodplain from the flowline\nTransect_width_unit default is used.\nHit Run.\n\nThe result is a line feature class of regularly spaced cross sections that well represent the channel conditions found in this reach.\nMake sure none of the lines are hanging outside the raster area.\n\nSelect each cross section and make sure green box is on left side of the bank going downstream. Start at upstream going downstream. Make sure the cross sections are parallel to bank. Edit each cross section so that they are perpendicular to the flow of the stream. Adjust their location if they are too close to highways or other smaller streams. The purpose is to get a cross section that extend the full width of the floodplain.\n\nIf cross sections cannot be moved without overlapping, they can be deleted. This may occur with tight bends or some meandering of the stream.\n\n\n\n\nXS Resequence (only for the newest dataset)\n\nRun only if any cross sections were deleted in the adjustment process.\n\n\n\nCalculate Cross Section Watershed Area (only for newest dataset)\n\nIn the fluvialgeomorph folder, expand layers and add NHDPlusFac_National.tif\nRight click the layer, go to data, then export raster\nAdd the output to whatever year folder.\nClipping geometry is displaying current extent. Make sure you are zoomed out to the whole county, so each site is located within extent.\n\nOptional: Create a clip for each project site of the NHDPlusFac_National.tif with the extent zoomed out 1:50000 centered on the site.\n\nGo to FluvialGeomorph toolbox. Add Wastershed Area tool.\nSnap distance is 100.\nStart with the more recent data first.\nHit Run.\n\nIf it doesn’t work zoom into the mile radius of site and clip FAC. Having a smaller clip will also reduce the tool runtime.\nThe result is a new attribute field in the XS feature class that has a calculated watershed area for each regularly spaced cross section.\n\nOnce it is done running, open attribute table and see if anything in the watershedareaSqMile is off.\n\nSome of the cross sections Watershed_Area_SqMile may not follow the trend. If this is the case, manually enter in the values to fill in the gaps. If most of the cross sections are missing these or display incorrect values, rerun Watershed Area tool and increase the snap distance.\nCheck for other streams and bodies of water feeding into the stream that would validate the abrupt changes in the watershed area.\n\nImport the finished xs_300_100 to the earlier year feature dataset.\n\n\n\nXS River Position\n\nIn the FluvialGeomorph toolbox, select XS River Position.\nEnter feature dataset for more recent geodatabase.\nInput Cross Sections.\nInput Flowline Points.\nHit Run.\nThe result adds new fields in the attribute table of the XS feature class.\nTwo temporary charts will populate the Contents tab under the Cross Section Line Feature Class (XS Seq by km_to_mouth, XS Seq by Watershed Area sq mile). If the charts are removed from the contents pane, you will need to run the XS River Position Tool to view them again.\n\nOpen both Charts and inspect for any issues in the data.\nNote: This step provides charts which help see if there are gaps in the data.\n\nRepeat XS River Position for the older gdb.\n\n\n\nXS Points\n\nIn the FluvialGeomorph toolbox, select XS Points.\nEnter feature dataset for more recent geodatabase.\nInput Cross Sections.\nInput dem_hydro.\nChange dem_units to ft.\nInput REM for the REM_dem.\nStation Distance is 1.\nHit Run.\nPoints have been created every foot along the Cross Section with an Elevation. This will provide a visual elevation profile for each cross section.\nRepeat these steps for the older gdb.\n\n\n\nXS Point Classify\n\nIn the FluvialGeomorph toolbox, select XS Points Classify.\nEnter feature dataset for the most recent year.\nInput XS points.\nInput channel polygon.\nInput floodplain polygon.\nLeave buffer distance default.\nRepeat for earlier year XS Points.",

    "text": "Check the stream name\nAll of the tools depend on consistent reach naming! Ensuring consistent naming begins with deriving the “flowline” fc. The ReachName field must contain the same value for all of the fc’s within a reach geodatabase. This is the single biggest gotcha we find running these tools. If tools aren’t working correctly and you’re sure you’ve done everything else right, consistent stream names is the first thing to check!\n\n\nCross section labels at the correct interval\nCross section labels usually cannot be placed on every cross section or the map or graph becomes unreadable due to label crowding. The xs_label_freq parameter can be adjusted to adequately space cross section labels. Typically xs_label_freq = 10 works for regularly spaced cross sections and xs_label_freq = 2 works for riffle cross sections.\n\n\nCross sections cover the full extent of the flowine\nThe flowline fc extends from the downstream end of the reach to the upstream end. Cross sections should be spaced regularly across the entire reach, without any gaps at the upper or lower end.\n\n\nMap basemap displaying correctly\nThe overview maps should contain an aerial photo or shaded relief elevation basemap.",

Use the ESRI Explore tool to check the DEM elevation values. By convention in FluvialGeomorph, DEM values must always have vertical units = feet.\n\n\nElevation ranges are similar between surveys\nAlthough stream elevations can change over time, the elevation ranges between subsequent survey dates should be roughly similar. If the elevation ranges are drastically different, check the terrain development steps for each survey time period to ensure that the elevation data was processed correctly.\n\n\nMultiple surveys are labeled correctly\nReports that contain multiple surveys should be entered in the same way to ensure they are labeled and symbolized (e.g., each survey drawn with the same color in each report) the same way across all reports. Follow these guidelines to ensure consistency:\n\nMost recent survey listed at the top, with earlier surveys listed in reverse chronological order.\nSurvey date indicates the date flown (e.g., not the contract or delivery date).\n\n\n\nMultiple surveys are correctly calibrated to the base year\nOn the longitudinal profile graphs, each survey line should start and end at the same x-axis station value. In other words, one survey line should not end before or after another survey line. Check the far right edge of the longitudinal graph to ensure all survey’s have the same ending value.\nIf all of the surveys’ last station values do not align, it means that the previous surveys were not correctly calibrated to the base year flowline. Previous year surveys will need to have the Flowline Points tool rerun using the base year survey’s flowline_points for calibration.\n\n\nStationing in the correct units\nUnits can be chosen for the longitudinal profile stationing.

Given the complexities of automatically calculating watershed area for high resolution stream features, some watershed areas may not have been calculated correctly. Rerunning the Watershed Area tool or manual adjustment of the Watershed_Area_SqMile field may be required.\n\nWatershed values are reasonable.\nWatershed area must increase moving downstream.\n\n\n\nElevation smoothing is acceptable\nHigh resolution LiDAR derived stream elevations can be noisy. Smoothing the elevations longitudinally is a way reduce noise. However, too much smoothing can be applied, eliminating any of the relationships we want to observe. By visually comparing the raw elevation and the smoothed elevation graphs, verify that the amount of smoothing sufficiently reduces noise, but does not not go too far and removes substantive variation. Smoothing is controlled in the XS Dimension tools using the “loess_span” parameter.\n\n\nEnsure metrics values are smooth\nMany reach metrics are calculated using a longitudinal moving window analysis. The size of the moving window is controlled in the XS Dimensions tools using the “lead_n” parameter. A smaller value applies a narrower moving mindow and a larger value applies a wider moving window. If the moving window is too small, metric values will be highly variable along the stream. As the moving window size gets larger, metric value variation will be reduced.\n\n\nSlope values are reasonable\nSlope values should be greater than zero. If negative slopes are being recorded, it usually means that the moving window size needs to be increased.\n\n\nSinuosity values are reasonable\nSinuosity values should be greater than one.",

In addition to following the guidance in the previous chapters when preparing the data and running each tool, this chapter will provide a checklist of items you’ll need to verify after each report completes. Reports are the place where all your hard work comes together! Your work is not complete just because the tools run without any errors. A lot of datasets must work together to make these reports come out cleanly. Because these reports integrate so many individual datasets, many issues aren’t discovered until you run the reports.",
