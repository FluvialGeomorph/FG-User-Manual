A reference list is presented immediately after the final numbered chapter
of the report, but before any appendixes. Formats and styles prescribed in
the Chicago Manual of Style should be used. Most ERDC reports will use
the author-date system and corresponding reference list form described in
the Chicago Manual. An alternative style prescribed in the Chicago Manual,
the note-bibliography system, may be used by authors working in disciplines
in which that style is customary. 

The reference list should include every information source cited in text
plus any uncited sources that were drawn upon. The reference list for this
Guide, presented on page 28, may be used as a model for common types of
source documentation including books, serial publications, government
documents, and unpublished material.
